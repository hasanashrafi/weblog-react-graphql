-Project Overview
This project is a GraphQL-based application that utilizes the Apollo Client library to fetch and manage data. The application is designed to retrieve and display blog information, including the blog's title, content, and author details.

-Technologies Used
GraphQL: A query language for APIs that allows for flexible and efficient data retrieval.
Apollo Client: A popular JavaScript library for building GraphQL-based applications.
JavaScript: The primary programming language used for this project.

-Features
Blog Information Retrieval: The application can fetch and display detailed information about a specific blog, including:
Blog title
Blog content
Author details (ID, name, email)
Dynamic Querying: The application uses GraphQL queries to dynamically retrieve data based on the provided blog ID.

-Future Development
Expanded Data Retrieval: Future updates may include the ability to retrieve additional data, such as comments, tags, or categories.
User Authentication: Integration with user authentication mechanisms to enable secure data access and modification.
Real-time Updates: Implementation of real-time updates using GraphQL subscriptions to enable instant data synchronization.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
